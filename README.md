This project is a documentation-based development of a web application designed for an online pharmacy system. The project includes various diagrams and detailed descriptions that document the functional and non-functional requirements, user interactions, and system features. The documentation style used in this project incorporates:

Use Case Diagrams for visualizing the system's functionality from the perspective of different users (customers, doctors, retailers).
Activity Diagrams to represent the flow of tasks and user interactions within the system.
Sequence Diagrams to show the sequence of interactions between system components during various processes like order placement and prescription verification.
Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) to map the flow of data and interactions across the system.
Windows Navigation Diagrams to illustrate the UI structure and navigation flow.
These diagrams, along with detailed textual descriptions, provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's design, functionalities, and how different components work together to fulfill business requirements.
